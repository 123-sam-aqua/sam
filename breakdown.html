     <p>Breakdown cover is a type of policy that means you’ll get help from a trained mechanic at the roadside if your car, van or motorbike breaks down. This is also known as Roadside Assistance.</p>

     <p>With Roadside Assistance, if your car breaks down over 1/4 mile from home, a mechanic will try to fix your vehicle on the spot. If they can't, you’ll get breakdown recovery to the nearest garage.</p>
  
     <p>You can also add options to your policy like At Home, National Recovery, Onward Travel and Parts & Garage Cover. You can select as many as you like, allowing you to create a personalised breakdown cover policy. This gives you more cover in more places as well as more choices in the event of a breakdown. </p>

     <p>Our experienced patrols deal with many car breakdown causes in the UK, including flat batteries, tyre puncture, and lost keys. They can also rescue you in dangerous situations, such as being broken down on the motorway.</p>

    <p>We're on call 24/7, so having breakdown cover gives you peace of mind that you'll never be left stranded.</p>
