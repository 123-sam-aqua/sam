    <h2>Why do I need car insurance?</h2>    <!--this code is for theory-->
        <p>Car insurance is required by law, unless you've registered your vehicle as being off the road.</p>
        
        <p>The minimum level of insurance is third party only, which covers you against liability to third parties following a road traffic accident.</p>
        
        <p>Third party, fire and theft provides the same cover as third party, plus cover in the event of your car being stolen or damaged by fire.</p>
        
        
        <h2>What types of car insurance are available?</h2>     <!--this code is for theory-->
       <p> We offer 3 levels of comprehensive car insurance to choose from â€“ Silver, Gold and Platinum.</p>
        
        <p>Silver has a good level of features and benefits, and you can select any additional cover that you prefer.</p>
        <p>Gold with a Defaqto 5 Star Rating is an excellent product that includes Motor Legal Assistance.</p>
